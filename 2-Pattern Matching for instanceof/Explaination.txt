Java 17 introduces a short way of pattern matching for the instanceof operator, which helps to simplify the code required for type checks. 
With pattern matching, you can extract the value of the checked object into a new variable if the check succeeds. 
This new variable can then be used in following code. It eliminates the need to cast the object into the expected type.

Note that this was a preview feature introduced under Java 14 Features. It has become a permanent feature under the list of Java 17 features.
