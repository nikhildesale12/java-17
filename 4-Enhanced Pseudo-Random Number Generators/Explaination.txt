“Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators” introduced under Java 17 Features. This feature provides additional pseudo-random number
 generators (PRNGs) that can be used to generate random numbers in Java applications. The new PRNGs are designed to be faster and more 
secure than the existing PRNGs in Java.

The new PRNGs are implemented as instances of the SplittableRandom class, which provides a way to generate a sequence of pseudo-random 
numbers that can be split and used to create new PRNG instances. This allows multiple threads to generate random numbers independently 
and with low contention, which can improve performance in multi-threaded applications.

For example, below code demonstrates the concept of using the SplittableRandom class to generate random numbers:

SplittableRandom random = new SplittableRandom();
int randomNumber = random.nextInt();
In the example, we create a new instance of the SplittableRandom class and use its nextInt() method to generate a random integer. The 
nextInt() method returns a pseudo-random integer that is uniformly distributed between Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE.

We can also use the SplittableRandom class to generate random numbers in a range, For example:

SplittableRandom random = new SplittableRandom();
int randomNumberInRange = random.nextInt(10, 20);
In the example, we use the nextInt(int bound) method to generate a pseudo-random integer that is uniformly distributed between 10 
(inclusive) and 20 (exclusive).

Another useful feature of the SplittableRandom class is that it allows us to split the PRNG and create new instances that generate 
independent sequences of random numbers. For example, below code demonstrates the concept:

SplittableRandom random1 = new SplittableRandom();
SplittableRandom random2 = random1.split();
In the example, we create a new instance of the SplittableRandom class and then split it to create a new instance that generates an 
independent sequence of random numbers. The two instances can be used in separate threads to generate random numbers with low contention.
