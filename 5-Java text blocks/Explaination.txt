Java has never prided itself on its ability to perform String manipulation.

Previously, the simple task of hard-coding formatted text within a Java program was difficult because it required String terminators, 
concatenators and esoteric escape sequences that made text embedded within a Java program difficult to both read and write. 
But in Java 17, you can now use text blocks, which make the use of text in a Java program much more natural.

Compare a traditional block of text embedded within a Java program to the new, Java 17 text block feature.

Prior to Java 17, the text block looked like this:

String oldTextBlock = "<html>\n" +
              "    <body>\n" +
              "        <em>Cool LTS Java 17 Features</em>\n" +
              "    </body>\n" +
              "</html>\n";
Now, it looks like this:

String newTextBlock = """
              <html>
                  <body>
                      <em>Cool LTS Java 17 Features</em>\
                  </body>
              </html>
              """;
This Java 17 feature represents a marked usability improvement from prior iterations.
