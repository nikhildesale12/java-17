Java 17 introduced a new feature called “Pattern Matching for switch Statements” that allows developers to simplify the code 
for switch statements that involve pattern matching. This feature provides a short and more readable syntax to handle multiple
conditions in switch statements.

The new feature allows developers to use patterns to match against the value of an object of any type.

A variable pattern allows you to match against a specific value and assign it to a variable. A type pattern allows you to match against 
the type of a value.
